# prog_1 (1st course in CS curriculum)
# All the code here are from my CS assignments and tutoring sessions that I made myself on the side and reviewed with the students.
# There are times were I need to code those assignments myself as there may be things students have missed (dependencies or bad structure or indentation of the code)
# In fact, I just like typing the code myself as well to keep my skills up and have some memory refresh and apply new coding practices I learned afterward.
